# Micromouse-path-solving-algorithm-
A minimum distance path finding algorithm between two points using modified Dijkstra algorithm. programming Language used is python and tkinter library is used for user interface.

Adjancy_matrix_gen.py  contain the code for generating adjancy matrix for each 400 vertices.

backened.py  contains the logic for genrating minimum path for each source vertex and all vertex(including destination vertex) and also generate parent list

pathAI.py contain the the code for GUI and interlinks backend with front end.
